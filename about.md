# About Me

I am a 4th-year Computer Engineering major. After I built my first gaming computer, my desire to learn all about computing performance and architecture began to sprout. My goals and motivation align with computer hardware companies: to design speedier, lower cost, and power-efficient chips to empower all who require more than what today can offer.

I'm on a journey to gain a true full-stack understanding of the computer with classes from algorithms, high-level software engineering, computer graphics/AI/HPC all the way to the compiler, microarchitecture, VLSI circuits, and fabrication.
