    <h1>Raspberry Pi Pico Cluster</h1>
<h2></h2>

<p>The goal of this project is to build a 8 Raspberry Pi Pico cluster to gain:
    - Physical intuition of how computers parallelize
    - A testbed for testing the scalability of different parallel algorithms
    - Explore optimizing energy as a variable of overall system performance
    - Familiarity with the Raspberry Pi ecosystem
    - Experience in basic electronics (especially in power)</p>

<p>There will be no fancy packaging. Just simple breadboard and wires to connect the picos.</p>
